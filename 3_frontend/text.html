<h1>Subway Sounds</h1>

<h2>The subway is loud, and everyone knows it. But what does that mean for the
people who experience it every day?</h2>

<p><span class='dyn-text'>Highlighted text</span> updates in real time.</p>

<p>Subway Sounds is an experimental project to capture the ambience of the Times
Square subway station in real time. Unlike past studies of sound intensity in
subway stations, this project explores the sights, sounds, and voices of four
levels of the station, from the surface down to the platforms, using streamed
sound intensities from the busiest station in New York City.</p>

<p>According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the New York
subway is the seventh largest system in the world, and Times Square served over
65 million passengers in 2015. Audio sensors at the various levels of the
station – the surface, the concourse, by the 1-2-3 trains and the 7 train –
record the sound and stream it to our servers, and based on the information
received, we construct a narrative.</p>

<p>Due to logistical, technical and security challenges, we have been unable to
deploy audio sensors in the station; as such, we have simulated an official
stream using data we collected manually over 30-minute windows on two days in
April. With access to a public MTA stream of readings from audio sensors
throughout the system, or with permission to install our own, this experiment
would provide an insight into the varying sounds of the Times Square subway
station.</p>

<h3>The Surface</h3>

<p class='dyn-text' id='0-1'></p>

<p>“Party station” is the term Gias Uddin uses for Times Square. A newsstand
worker at the 116th Street subway station on the 1 line, Uddin passes through
Times Square daily to get to work. “Sometimes I want to dance with all the music
and commotion,” he says, “and sometimes I want to slap those musicians making
noise.” He adds, “If you are happy, train noise is no problem; if you are
unhappy, all noise is bad.”</p>

<p>But at the surface level of Times Square station, it is not the train that
causes all the noise. Sirens from police cars, ambulances and fire engines are
far more common. And, like the trains, they’re not a consistent source of noise,
but transient. The reaction these wails get are unsurprising: winces, fingers in
ears and clenched eyes – just in case that helps drown out the noise.</p>

<p id='0-2' class='dyn-text'></p>

<p>The sound levels here can get loud, but other stations, despite not even
being half as busy, are often worse off. Take, for example, the elevated 125th
Street station on the 1 line, which had an annual ridership of 2.5 million to
Times Square’s 65 million. Half a block down, Leyla and Mario Gomez run Thrifty
Deli, situated alongside a stretch of elevated tracks. They say the vibrations
from overhead trains have caused cans to fall off the shelves in their basement
storage unit. More ominously, though, as Leyla Gomez says, “Muggers smoke joints
and rob people under the sky rail. And when there is noise like that at night,
no one will hear you scream.” Times Square, on the other hand, is set to <a

href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/times-square-police-station-to-get-a-makeover.html">has
plummeted</a>.</p>


<h3>The Concourse</h3>

<p>A slew of sounds blend together in the concourse, twenty feet below the
surface. The Shuttle (S) train, which has one job – transporting people from
Grand Central and back – stops at this level.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='1-1'></p>

<p>The Upper Mezzanine in Times Square is a coveted spot for musicians. The
space opposite where the S train stops is one of three spots in Times Square
station for which musicians have to audition. In total, there are thirty such
MUSIC sites around the city that are part of <a target='_blank' href="http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/muny/locations.html">MTA’s Art and Design Program</a>.
Musicians play a range of instruments including Andean pipes, Korean drums,
steel drums, Cajun cellos and Flamenco guitars while their songs span many
genres.</p>

<p>This musical mélange is the primary cause of the concourse cacophony. In its
absence, this level is almost quiet.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='1-2'></p>

<p>There are regulations that the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9735">Occupational Health and Safety Administration</a>
(OSHA) have in place to protect employees from excessive exposure to high noise
levels. For an eight-hour workday, noise exposure above 90 decibels is deemed
excessive. For every five decibel increase in the noise levels, this duration
goes down by half.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='1-3'></p>

<p>Two transit police officers, Bae and Sandhu, stationed on this level say they
are not allowed to use hearing protection because they have to be constantly
vigilant. Bae taps the radio attached to his shoulder. “What if there’s a
message from Central? What if there’s an emergency?” he asks. These aren’t
far-off questions. On the back of terrorist attacks in European cities, even if
there are no known immediate, specific threats to the United States, security
measures <a target='_blank'
href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/03/22/statement-secretary-jeh-c-johnson-attacks-today-brussels-belgium">are
increased</a> at the major airports and transit stops in the country. As a
result, even though Bae suffers from ringing in his left ear, he has to brook
the sounds of the subway station for eight hours a day. He doesn’t know what
causes the ringing, but he says it could be a result of his time in the Army or
his time working in subway stations. Before Bae and Sandhu were assigned to the
Times Square concourse in March 2016, the two officers were stationed in several
different stations in Brooklyn.</p>

<h3>The 1-2-3 Trains</h3>

<p>The 1-2-3 trains run twenty feet below the Shuttle. Four tracks service these
three lines, all of which stop here. This level can get loud, as multiple trains
arrive and depart simultaneously, throughout the day and night.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='2-1'></p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='2-2'></p>

<p>It’s not just these fleeting spikes in sound intensity that have adverse
effects on those who spend their working day in the underground station.</p>

<p>Hasan Bachu runs a newsstand meters away, between the platforms for the 1-2-3
trains and the platform for the 7 trains. For the past eight years, he’s
occupied the same spot for eight hours a day, enduring the crowds and the
clamor. “I cannot hear customers and customers cannot hear me,” he says. He
insists that the loud music, a constant from between 3 and 7 PM most days, is
more insufferable than the trains. “Those four hours,” he says, “I have a
headache.” He also says customers are less likely to stop by at his shop during
those hours.</p>

<p>This is frustrating for Bachu and others vendors who work at the shops in the
mezzanines. One of Bachu’s employees has experienced a constant ringing noise in
his ear that led him to meet with an audiologist, though it’s not clear that the
subway noise is the cause.</p>

<p>Ramon Zabala, a guitarist who performs across from Bachu’s shop a few times a
week, agrees with Bachu that the station is loud. While Bachu resents Zabala’s
presence and the sounds coming from his amplifier, Zabala instead takes issue
with the train noise, which often interferes with his playing. “Sometimes I
cannot hear myself,” he says. He prefers quieter areas, but, not being part of
the <a target='_blank'
href='http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/muny/factsheet.html'>MTA Arts &amp; Design
MUSIC program</a>, he doesn’t have a choice: in order to make money playing
music, he travels from station to station, looking for any location where a
rival musician hasn’t yet set up shop.</p>

<p>Specific complaints may differ, but everyone agrees: subway stations are way
too loud.</p>

<p>Tony Evans, an acoustic consultant for ATS Consulting, says that transit
systems aren't obligated to fix noise problems unless they exceed the FTA
criteria and the repair would be cost effective. In his experience, he finds
that the sound intensities are annoying but within the levels specified by the
FTA, which provides little incentive for the MTA to address the issues and
ameliorate the situation.</p>

<p>But, since the mid-1970s, the MTA has included budget items to address the
noise levels in the subway. During Michael Bloomberg’s term as Mayor, the City
even implemented a noise code for transit operations, which required, among
other things, minimizing curve and break screeches and limiting sound levels to
80 decibels by 2012. The code also encouraged the MTA to “develop noise
mitigation strategies and incorporate such plans into their capital planning
goals.”</p>

<p>According to MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz, the efforts to quiet track-related
noise have included the installation of continuously welded rail and resilient
rail fasteners, as well as track lubrication along sharp curves. The trains also
use ring-damped wheels now, which reduce the noise. Composite brake shoes, which
are meant to eliminate screeching stops, are used on all subway cars.</p>

<p>Yet on the 1-2-3 platform, the trains screech while pulling in and
departing.</p>

<p>Ortiz also says that many subway stations have noise absorbing barriers, as
well as acoustic materials above and below the platforms, which help create a
quieter environment compared to two decades ago. But in the absence of
historical data, it is hard to say how much progress has been made.</p>

<h3>The 7 Train</h3>

<p class='dyn-text' id='3-1'></p>

<p>Eddie, an MTA cleaner who works at multiple subway stations including Times
Square, has worn earplugs since he started working for the MTA nineteen years
ago. He recognized then that his job would expose him to extended periods of
loud noise that might damage his hearing, and he wanted to protect his hearing
for one simple reason: “I just enjoy listening to music,” Eddie says. “I wanted
to continue doing that.” Like the police officers, he is not allowed to wear
earplugs, lest he miss an announcement over the PA system—only train conductors
and operators, he says, are allowed to use hearing protection equipment — but so
far, he has not been reprimanded. Like Bachu, it’s not the sound of the trains
that bother him, but the musicians. “Especially those drummer boys,” he
says.</p>

<p>Dr. Marc B Kramer, an audiologist, treats hearing loss and advises the New
York City Employee Retirement System (NYCERS). He says, “screeches are annoying,
much like fingernails on blackboards, but that doesn’t mean they’re hazardous.”
It boils down to how much exposure and for how long.</p>

<p>Sudden variations in sounds can be jarring as well. According to James
Cowen’s <i>The Effects of Sound on People</i>, stress reactions can be caused by “an
individual’s sensitivity to different sources and types of noise.” Cowen goes on
to say that low sound levels associated with any threatening source can result
in a greater stress reaction than high levels associated with a non-threatening
source or a source that individuals are acclimatised to. In the subway, the
plethora of sounds can result in greater stress.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='3-2'></p>

<p>Dr. Frank Goldsmith is the Director of Occupational Health at Transport
Workers Union (TWU) Local 100, which has over 40,000 members. He says that the
MTA has a hearing protection program that identifies the job titles most at risk
for compromised hearing, and coordinates annual hearing tests and provides basic
hearing protection for workers in these positions. But Goldsmith argues this
does not address the root of the problem: loud trains.</p>

<p>Goldsmith also points out that workers can be wary of their jobs receiving
extra scrutiny from the MTA, in case that scrutiny makes the MTA reconsider
whether that job needs to exist in the first place. For the workers, it’s
Catch-22 situation: if they don’t raise their concerns, they could suffer from
hearing loss; if they do, they might lose their jobs. Even jobs covered by this
hearing conservation program come with caveats. For example, according to
Goldsmith, employees cannot file for compensation from New York State until they
have been away from the job for at least six months.</p>

<p>The New York City Subway is an old system, and its noise problem was
recognized at least as early as 1930, when the Noise Abatement Commission
attempted to record and study sounds from around the city. Nearly a century
later, the subway has changed very little: the Second Avenue line is still under
construction, and the trains are still too loud for comfort. Somehow, the city’s
kaleidoscopic assortment of inhabitants have learned to tolerate New York’s less
desirable features: the sweet aroma of sewage in the summertime, an underground
empire of rats, the screeching clamor of the subway system. And other New
Yorkers.</p>
