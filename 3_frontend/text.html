<h1>Subway Sounds</h1>

<h2>The subway is loud, and everyone knows it. But what does that mean for the
people who experience it every day?</h2>

<p><span class='dyn-text'>Highlighted text</span> updates in real time.</p>

<p>Subway Sounds is an experimental project to capture the ambience of the Times
Square subway station in real time. Unlike past studies of sound intensity in
subway stations, this project explores the sights, sounds, and voices of four
levels of the station, from the surface down to the platforms, using streamed
sound intensities from the busiest station in New York City.</p>

<p>The station served over 65 million passengers in 2015, according to the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which also says it is the seventh
largest system in the world.  Audio sensors at the various levels of the station –
the surface, the concourse, by the 1-2-3 trains and the 7 train – record the
sound and stream it to our servers, and based on the information received, we
construct a narrative.</p>

<p>Due to logistical, technical and security challenges, we have been unable to
deploy audio sensors in the station; as such, we have simulated an official
stream using data we collected manually over 30-minute windows on two days in
April. Had we been given the necessary permissions to install sensors, or if the
MTA made such a stream publicly available, this experiment would provide an
insight into the varying sounds of the Times Square subway station.</p>

<h3>The Surface</h3>

<p class='dyn-text' id='0-1'></p>

<p>“Party station” is the term Gias Uddin uses for Times Square. A newsstand
worker at the 116th subway station, Uddin passes through Times Square daily to
get to work. He says, “Sometimes I want to dance with all the music and
commotion, and sometimes I want to slap those musicians making noise.” He adds,
“If you are happy, train noise is no problem; if you are unhappy, all noise is
bad.”</p>

<p>But at Times Square, train noise cannot be heard at the surface. Sirens from
police cars, ambulances and fire engines are far more common. And, like the
trains, they’re not a consistent source of noise, but transient. The reaction
these wails get are unsurprising: winces, fingers in ears and clenched eyes –
just in case that helps drown out the noise. </p>

<p>The sound levels here can get loud, but other stations, despite not even
being half as busy, are often worse off. Take, for example, the elevated 125th
Street station on the 1 line, which had an annual ridership of 2.5 million to
Times Square’s 65 million. Leyla and Mario Gomez run “Thrifty Deli,” which is
underneath the station. They say the vibrations from overhead trains have caused
cans to fall off the shelves in their basement storage unit. More ominously,
though, as Leyla Gomez says, “Muggers smoke joints and rob people under the sky
rail. And when there is noise like that at night, no one will hear you scream.”
Times Square, on the other hand, is set to <a target='_blank' href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/nyregion/times-square-police-substation-is-set-to-be-overhauled.html?_r=0">lose its police building</a> as crime in
the area <a target='_blank' href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/times-square-police-station-to-get-a-makeover.html">has plummeted</a>.</p>


<h3>The Concourse</h3>

<p>A slew of sounds blend together in the concourse, twenty feet below the
surface. The Shuttle (S) train, that has one job – transporting people from
Grand Central Station and back – stops at this level.</p>

<p class='dyn-text' id='1-1'></p>

<p>The Upper Mezzanine in Times Square is a coveted spot for musicians. The
space opposite where the S train stops is one of three spots in Times Square
station for which musicians have to audition. In total, there are thirty such
MUSIC sites around the city that are part of <a target='_blank' href="http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/muny/locations.html">MTA’s Art and Design Program</a>.
Musicians play a range of instruments including Andean pipes, Korean drums,
steel drums, Cajun cellos and Flamenco guitars while their songs span many
genres.</p>

<p>This musical mélange is the primary cause of the concourse cacophony. In its
absence, this level is almost quiet.</p>
